# Computing Resources
* CPU
* Memory
* Diskspace
* Foundations for all Azure

## IaaS - Infrastructure as a Service
* Virtual Machines - you manage the OS
* Containers - lightweight app hosts

## PaaS - Platform as a Service

* Integrates with Excel

## Data Lake Analytics
* U-SQL -SQL and C# like language

## Stream Analytics
* Working with real time data
* e.g. real time fraud detection

## Machine Learning
* Analyse data and come up with model
* Input data and probable outcomes come out

## Data Factory
* ETL tool for cloud
* Monitoring and retry capabilities

# Networking
* Hybrid Connections - some in azure some in your own data centre
 * Site-to-site or Point-to-site VPN
 * Express VPN

 ## Application Networking
 * CDN (Content Delivery Network) - caches in closer location to customer
 * Traffic Manager - flexible patterns of traffic, even non-azure can be used
 * Azure DNS

 # Services
 * Web Services, HTTP Services
 * Azure App Services
 * Azure API Management - rich HTTP APIs
 * Web , API, Mobile & Logic Apps
 * Leverage Common App Services (e.g. Login)

 # Active Directory
 * Integrates with your existing
 * Identity and directory services in the cloud
 * Single sign on for Azure SaaS apps

 # Accessing Apps
 * Web Authentication
 * Social Providers - Business 2 Consumer Directory (e.g. through facebook)
 * Application Proxy - url, azure, through to on-premises proxy active directory
 * Multie-Factor Authentication Support e.g. need to get a text to authenticate too
